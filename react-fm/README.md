## Local Testing

### Running Application

- Run the react application with `npm run dev`.
- This command will start the react application in local.

There are two more scripts:

preview and https-preview

preview command will boot up local static web server that serves the files from dist folder. It's an easy way to check if the production build looks OK in your local environment.
https-preview is the same, but with HTTPS. It's handy for testing your PWA capabilities in your local environment.

- `https-localhost` - It's a simple way to run your application on localhost with https - `npm run https-preview` after `npm run build`
