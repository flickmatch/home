### Guides

**TODO**

### Basic setup

- Install `node` and `npm` with the latest versions.
- Change your current working directory to `react-fm`.
- Run the command `npm install`.
- Get the home.env file from this link https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VF5jvZy3BQ2lcHbYVkBbR_GmftKuzi9I and add it to the root directory of react-fm.

### IDE Setup

You are free to use your own IDE but VSCode is recommended. Install the plugins eslint and prettier for this.

**Note**: If you prefer to use other IDEs, please add steps in this section.

## Local Testing

### Running Application

- Run the react application with `npm run dev`.
- This command will start the react application in local.

There are two more scripts:

preview and https-preview

preview command will boot up local static web server that serves the files from dist folder. It's an easy way to check if the production build looks OK in your local environment.
https-preview is the same, but with HTTPS. It's handy for testing your PWA capabilities in your local environment.

- `https-localhost` - It's a simple way to run your application on localhost with https - `npm run https-preview` after `npm run build`

### Unit Testing/ Integration Testing
